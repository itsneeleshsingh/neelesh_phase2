# 1. Web Gauntlet
This challenge involves bypassing filters in a web application to perform SQL injection. Each round presents different filtering rules, requiring us to adapt our injection techniques accordingly.

## Solution:
1. I started by accessing the login page and noting the URL `http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:57056/`. The initial filter page showed "Filters: ***or…***", indicating the filters. I attempted an injection with username `admin` and any password. The response showed the SQL query:  
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='...'`.  
Recognizing the pattern, I realized SQL injection was possible.

2. I searched for how to comment out parts of SQL queries to bypass conditions. I learned that double hyphens `--` or multiline comment `/*` can be used.  
I tested `admin' --` which worked, as it commented out the rest of the query.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' -- AND password='gfdgsdbsd’
    ```

3. For the second round, the filters changed to "Round2: or and like = —". The double hyphen was disabled, so I used multiline comments: `admin' /*`. This again worked, allowing me to bypass filters. So the final SQL query that it showed was -
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' /* ' AND password='dvbsdcvcddv’
    ```

4. In the third round, the filters included `or`, `=`, `like`, `>`, `<`, and `—`. I tried the previous method but it didn't work. I then learned that terminating the SQL statement early with a semicolon could help. So I used `admin';` as username and any random password, which allowed me to inject and bypass this round.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';' AND password='dfsdsdsd’
    ```

5. In the fourth round, I faced filters with "Round4: or and = like > < -- admin". The word "admin" was tricky. After many research and hit and trials I realized that i can concatenate strings using `||` in SQL. I tested `ad'||'min'` as username, which worked to produce admin.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min';' AND password='fdsfsdfsf’
    ```

6. For the fifth round, the filters included extra "union admin". I was not able to figure out.But it suddenly striked that the previous command was not in the filters. So I used `ad'||'min'` again, which succeeded in bypassing all the rounds.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min';' AND password='sdfsdfsdfsd’
    ```

7. After refreshing the page, there was no falg showing. After that I noticed my flag was commented out in the PHP code in the filter page. I extracted the flag from the comment: `picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}`.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- I learned that SQL comments `--` and `/* */` can be used to bypass filters.
- Early termination of SQL queries with a semicolon `;` allows injection even when filters restrict certain keywords.
- String concatenation in SQL can be achieved with `||`, in this case we wrote admin using that.
- Using searches and going through different resources to get knowledge about some sql injection techniques.

## Notes:
Initially, I tried using `+` for string concatenation but it didn't work because SQL uses `||`(which i got to know later). Also, I spent some time trying to inject different injection techniques before using concatenation startegy and early termination.
